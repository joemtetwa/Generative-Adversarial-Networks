    "In the [60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html), \n",

    "feed it through a model we define as a subclass of ``nn.Module``,\n",
    "train this model on training data, and test it on test data.\n",
    "To see what's happening, we print out some statistics as the model\n",
    "is training to get a sense for whether training is progressing.\n",
    "However, we can do much better than that: PyTorch integrates with\n",
    "TensorBoard, a tool designed for visualizing the results of neural\n",

    "which can be read into PyTorch using `torchvision.datasets`.\n",

    "    2. Set up TensorBoard.\n",
    "    3. Write to TensorBoard.\n",
